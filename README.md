Deletes file extensions you choose from the Osu directory.

I made it because my Osu folder was in the tens of gigabytes.

You can choose to delete .jpg, .avi, .wav, and .png files. 

It works for any directory, but it will warn you if you haven't chosen the proper Osu directory.

When scanning, it will hang if there's a large amount of files (It hung for ~15 seconds when scanning for 50K files). Need to implement threading.
