Deletes file extensions you choose from the Osu directory.

You can choose to delete .jpg, .avi, .wav, and .png files. 

It works for any directory, but it will warn you if you haven't chosen the proper Osu directory.

When scanning, it will hang if there's a large amount of files (It hung for ~15 seconds when scanning for 50K files). Need to implement threading.

Keep in mind that deleting .png and .jpg files (backgrounds), Osu! will give you a message when starting a song, but it does not affect gameplay.
